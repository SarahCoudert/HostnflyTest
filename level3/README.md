# Level 3

The car owner now wants his money.
We decide to take a 30% commission on the rental price to cover our costs and have a solid business model.

The commission is split like this:
- half goes to the insurance
- 1€/day goes to the roadside assistance
- the rest goes to us

Compute the amount that belongs to the insurance, to the assistance and to us.
