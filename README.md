# Backend Challenge

## Guidelines

- solve the levels in ascending order
- send code back to me

You can have a look at the higher levels, but please do the **simplest thing** that could work for the level you're currently solving.

Disclaimer: the levels become more complex over time, so you will probably have to re-use some code and adapt it to the new requirements.
A good way to solve this is by using OOP and adding new layers of abstraction only when they become necessary.
Don't hesitate to write [shameless code](http://red-badger.com/blog/2014/08/20/i-spent-3-days-with-sandi-metz-heres-what-i-learned/) at first, and then refactor it in the next levels.

## Things to know
- all prices are stored as integers (in cents)
